                        <p>Welcome to the Office User Interface, further called OfficeUI. We've got everything you need to create great Web Applications. With OfficeUI, you're able to
                        to create a rich user interface which is similar to the user interface that Microsoft is using in their Office products, such as, but not limited to: Microsoft Word,
                        Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Excel, ...</p>

                        <p>
                            OfficeUI is built on top of AngularJS, meaning that you should have a knowledge of JavaScript and AngualrJS when you want to modify the project.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The purpose of this website is to provide end-users and developers with information on how OfficeUI should be installed, configured and extended.
                        </p>
