 * Notes:         The OfficeUI.scss file is the main file for all the OfficeUI components.
 *                This file will contain the styling for icons, actions, ribbon, buttons and a lot
 *                of other elements. However, there are references with other files to make sure that
 *                that we can use various styles and other elements.
 *
 * Remarks:       Some features have been included in order to help debugging stylesheets.
 *                The following 'debugging' features have been included:
 *                  - Css class (debug):  When you do apply this class on an element, the element
 *                                        itself will receive a dotted red border around it.
 *
 *                Some parts of the application does highly lean on the z-index property in order to
 *                show elements at the correct level. Therefore, all the elements which rely on a
 *                z-index property are showed below (highest z-index first, lowest latest).
 *                  - Application Icons (300) .
 *                  - Application Title (200).
 *                  - Ribbon Tabs (150).
 *                  - Header (100).
 *                  - Tabs Content (30).
