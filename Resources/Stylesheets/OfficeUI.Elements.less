/* ----- Buttons ----- */
/* Notes:
 * The OfficeUI Suite contains various types of buttons such as a normal button, an image button, ...
 * The section below gives an explanation about every type of button and also given an example on how to render them.
 *
 * Some classes have added 'ie-fix' on the end. This is because some functionalities are not available in all browsers.
 * Therefore that since class is being added because otherwise the element might not render correctly in Internet
 * Explorer.
 *
 * The class is 'ie-fix' is used to solve the following problems:
 * -  When you have an anchor <a href="#"> with another element in it, the anchor does not become :active when you
 *    click on the element itself. In other words, the active class is not bubbling up.
 *
 * ==================================================== Example ====================================================
 * Normal button:
 *
 *    Provides a normal button that just contains some plain text.
 *
 *    <a href="#" class="button">
 *        <span>Yes</span>
 *    </a>
 *
 * Normal button (defaulted):
 *
 *    Provides a normal button, the same as the above one, but a button which is focused by default, indicating
 *    that this is a default button.
 *
 *    <a href="#" class="button default-button">
 *        <span>Yes</span>
 *    </a>
